            is a spicy, stir-fried Chinese dish made with cubes of cooked chicken, peanuts, vegetables and chili peppers, and Sichuan peppercorns.

            Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, where spicy food is king and the signature
            spice of the region––the Sichuan Peppercorn––gives dishes a unique “numbing” effect.
            It’s almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add their fragrance and flavor,
            but also to numb your tongue so it can take more heat!
