            The Great Wall of China is a series of ancient fortifications built over 2,000 years ago to protect Chinese states from invasions.
            Stretching over 13,000 miles,
            it was mainly built during the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties and stands today as a symbol of China’s strength, history,
            and architectural skill.

            is a spicy, stir-fried Chinese dish made with cubes of cooked chicken, peanuts, vegetables and chili peppers, and Sichuan peppercorns.
            From its origins in Sichuan cuisine, the dish's popularity has spread throughout China,
            spawning a number of regional variations—some of which are less spicy than the classic version.

            Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, where spicy food is king and the signature
            spice of the region––the Sichuan Peppercorn––gives dishes a unique “numbing” effect.
            It’s almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add their fragrance and flavor,
            but also to numb your tongue so it can take more heat!
