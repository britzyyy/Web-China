            The Forbidden City, located in the heart of Beijing, was the imperial palace of China for nearly 500 years,

            The Terracotta Army is a massive collection of life-sized clay soldiers buried with China’s first emperor,
            Qin Shi Huang, over 2,000 years ago. Discovered in 1974 near Xi’an,
